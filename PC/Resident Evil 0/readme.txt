RE0 real time graphics mod (hotkeys for noise filter, color filter, etc)

Same as with RE1, with this mod I modified shaders responsible for effects that deserve to be in an options menu.

Place the files in the root folder of the game, "Resident Evil 0".

If you use the fps fix mod, which is also a "d3d9.dll", rename it to something else and uncomment the ProxyLib = "I:\Steam\steamapps\common\Resident Evil 0\fpsfix.dll" line in "DX9Settings.ini", writing the correct path to the renamed dll.

Hotkeys (by default all effects are untouched):

- F1: noise filter toggle.
- F2: color filter toggle.
- F3: fog toggle. It has three presets. One of them disables fog and shadows, and the other just the fog, but characters have the fog lighting on them.
- F4: bloom toggle. No drawbacks, as far as I could see.

Some of the effects are made to compensate each other's brightness and contrast, so sometimes disabling just one effect won't be a good idea. I don't have a clear cut suggestion as with RE1. Test for yourself what combination you like the most.

The noise filter was probably made in part to mask banding and compression artifacts. You will notice it in dark sports. I wouldn't have minded if the game size was doubled in exchange of better backgrounds image quality.
