Shader modifications for games and emulators.

WiiU: place the ".txt" files inside your game folder that is inside the "graphicPacks" folder.
PS2: use the latest 3Dmigoto build (https://github.com/bo3b/3Dmigoto/releases) in the PCSX2 root folder and paste/overwrite my files on top of that. You can only use one game fix at a time.
